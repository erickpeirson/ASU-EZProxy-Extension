ASU-EZProxy-Extension
=====================

This is a browser extensions that reloads pages through the ASU library proxy. So far I've covered Chrome and Firefox.

Installation: Firefox
---------------------

1. Download the .xpi file from the (most recent release)[https://github.com/erickpeirson/ASU-EZProxy-Extension/releases] 
for Firefox.
2. Follow (these installation instructions)[http://www.accessfirefox.org/Install_Addon_Manually.php] for installing an
extension from a file.
3. Add the EZProxy button to your toolbar by going to View > Toolsbars > Customize, and dragging the 
![ASU icon](https://raw.github.com/erickpeirson/ASU-EZProxy-Extension/master/Firefox/ezproxy@asu.edu/chrome/skin/icon.png)
icon into your toolbar.

Installation: Chrome
--------------------

1. Download the .zip file from the (most recent release)[https://github.com/erickpeirson/ASU-EZProxy-Extension/releases]
for Chrome.
2. Uncompress/extract the contents of the .zip file. You should see two files: ezproxy-extension.crx and 
ezproxy-extension.pem
3. Go to [chrome://settings/] and click on "Extensions" (at left). You should see a list of extensions that are installed 
in Chrome. 
4. Drag and drop the ezproxy-extension.crx file onto the list of extensions.
5. Follow the prompts to install the extension. You should now see the 
![ASU icon](https://raw.github.com/erickpeirson/ASU-EZProxy-Extension/master/Firefox/ezproxy@asu.edu/chrome/skin/icon.png)
icon in your toolbar.
