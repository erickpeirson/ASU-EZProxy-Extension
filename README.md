**Update: April 19, 2017** -- I simply don't have time to keep this up to date. But Ted Pavlic has a really nice (and elegant) solution using a bookmarklet: http://phaseportrait.blogspot.com/2012/07/bookmarklets-for-asu-library-proxy.html *-Erick*

ASU EZProxy Extension
=====================

This extension adds a button to your toolbar that, when clicked, reloads the current page through the ASU library's proxy.
The extension is available for both Firefox and Chrome.

Installation: Firefox
---------------------

1. Download the .xpi file from the [most recent release](https://github.com/erickpeirson/ASU-EZProxy-Extension/releases)
for Firefox.
2. Follow [these installation instructions](http://www.accessfirefox.org/Install_Addon_Manually.php) for installing an
extension from a file.
3. Add the EZProxy button to your toolbar by going to View > Toolsbars > Customize, and dragging the 
![ASU icon](https://raw.github.com/erickpeirson/ASU-EZProxy-Extension/master/Firefox/ezproxy@asu.edu/chrome/skin/icon.png)
icon into your toolbar.

Note: in newer versions of Firefox, your browser will remember which sites you prefer to access via proxy. Thus it may 
only be necessary to click the button once for each domain.

Installation: Chrome
--------------------

1. Download the .zip file from the [most recent release](https://github.com/erickpeirson/ASU-EZProxy-Extension/releases)
for Chrome.
2. Uncompress/extract the contents of the .zip file. You should see two files: ezproxy-extension.crx and 
ezproxy-extension.pem
3. Go to [chrome://settings/](chrome://settings/) and click on "Extensions" (at left). You should see a list of extensions
that are installed 
in Chrome. 
4. Drag and drop the ezproxy-extension.crx file onto the list of extensions.
5. Follow the prompts to install the extension. You should now see the 
![ASU icon](https://raw.github.com/erickpeirson/ASU-EZProxy-Extension/master/Firefox/ezproxy@asu.edu/chrome/skin/icon.png)
icon in your toolbar.
